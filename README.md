# osu-cleaner-cli
A simple program on python to remove unneeded files from osu! Songs folder. Somewhat of a rewrite of [that](https://github.com/henntix/osu-cleaner) tool, which is not cross-platform and does not work as intended.
## Usage
```bash
./osu-cleaner-cli \[-h --help] \[-v --version] \[<path to the osu songs directory> [--delete-videos] [--delete-hitsounds] [--delete-backgrounds] [--delete-skin-elements] [--delete-storyboard-elements]]
```
If no arguments/only filepath specified program will start in interactive mode
