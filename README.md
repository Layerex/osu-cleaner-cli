# osu-cleaner-cli
Script to remove unwanted files from osu! Songs directory. A rewrite of [that](https://github.com/henntix/osu-cleaner) tool, which is not cross-platform and does not work as intended.
## Usage
```
python3 osu-cleaner-cli.py [-h --help] [-v --version] [path to the osu! Songs directory [--delete-videos] [--delete-hitsounds] [--delete-backgrounds] [--delete-skin-elements] [--delete-storyboard-elements]]
```
If no arguments or only file path specified script will start in interactive mode.
