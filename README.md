# osu-cleaner-cli
A simple program on python to remove unwanted files from osu! Songs folder. Somewhat of a rewrite of [that](https://github.com/henntix/osu-cleaner) tool, which is not cross-platform and does not work as intended.
## Usage
```
./osu-cleaner-cli [-h --help] [-v --version] [<path to the osu songs directory> [--delete-videos] [--delete-hitsounds] [--delete-backgrounds] [--delete-skin-elements] [--delete-storyboard-elements]]
```
If no arguments/only filepath specified program will start in interactive mode
